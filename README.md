# Bézier and B-Spline Curve Visualization

This Python project demonstrates the generation and visualization of Bézier and B-spline curves using control points. The curves are drawn with the `matplotlib` library for clear and dynamic visual representations.

## Features

- **Bézier Curve**:
  - Generated using the De Casteljau algorithm.
  - Customizable control points for dynamic shapes.

- **B-Spline Curve**:
  - Supports variable degrees (linear, quadratic, cubic, etc.).
  - Allows customization of control points and knot vectors.

- **Easy Customization**:
  - All modifiable variables are located at the top of the script for simplicity.
  - Adjust control points, degree, and resolution directly.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or later
- Required libraries:
  - `numpy`
  - `matplotlib`
  - `scipy`

Install the dependencies using:
```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib scipy
